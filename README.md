# Welcome to Bloodlines, a The Vampire Diaries-inspired Minecraft plugin that brings the world of vampires, werewolves, and witches to your server! Live forever as a vampire, feed on human or animal blood, and harness unique abilities like compulsion, enhanced strength, and more. But be careful – your choices matter. Only vampires who feed on human blood can compel others!

This plugin is currently only compatible with Minecraft version 1.12.2, but future updates will expand support and add even more features.

Features
Vampire Feeding System:

Drink human blood to gain full powers, including compulsion, enhanced strength, speed, and regeneration.
Drink animal blood to gain weaker powers, but you lose the ability to compel.
Vampires who do not feed will experience weakness, slowness, and hunger.
Compulsion:

Vampires who feed on human blood can compel humans (players and NPCs) to follow commands, open doors, and drop items.
Blood Tiers:

Human Blood – Full strength, abilities, and compulsion.
Animal Blood – Weakened abilities, no compulsion.
No Blood – Debuffs like weakness and slowness.
Daylight Ring:

Wear a Daylight Ring to protect yourself from sunlight if you're a vampire.
Enhanced Abilities:

Super Speed and Strength for full vampires, plus night vision and regeneration.
Vampire, Werewolf, and Witch Abilities

Vampires can feed, compel, and enhance their power, while werewolves can transform and fight back, and witches cast spells to protect humans.

Join specific vampire bloodlines, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Customize your experience as a vampire, werewolf, or witch!
